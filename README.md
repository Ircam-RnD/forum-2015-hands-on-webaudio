Forum 2015 - Hands-On WebAudio
=======================================================

Example application created during during the WebAudio Worshop at IRCAM in November 2015.

To setup and run the application, open a terminal and type the following commands:

```
cd path/to/forum-2015-hands-on-webaudio
npm install
npm run watch
```

_note: the example uses motion sensors to control synthesis parameters and will thus be more interesting on a mobile device_
